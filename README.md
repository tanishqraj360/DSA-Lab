List of Programs for Lab Test
Course Code: BCSL305 Semester: 3rd
Course Title: Data Structures Laboratory

1(a) Write a program to accept 3 integers and find the maximum among 3 numbers using functions and pointers.
1(b) Write a C program using pointer for searching the desired element from the array using pointers

2(a) Write a program to accept 3 integers and find the maximum among 3 numbers using functions and pointers.
2(b) Write a program to find the maximum element in each row of the matrix using pointers

3(a) Write a C program to read and display the Time in specified format. Create a structure called TIME with hour (int), minute(int), second(int) and next(self- referencing pointer ) as its members. Dynamically create two variables of structure TIME and link the first variable to the second one and display it. Write a Display function that takes address of first TIME variable and displays both times in the format h:m:s.
3(b) Write a C program to read and display the student details. Define a structure 'Student' with fields name(string) , usn(int), marks of 3 subjects (int) and average(float) in it. Store the details of n students in an array of structure 'Student'. Display the details of all students in the descending order their total marks.

4. Write a C program using dynamic variables and pointers, to construct singly linked list. The operations to be supported are:
   (i) Insert at the front of a list
   (ii) Deleting a node based on specified value
   (iii) Displaying al the nodes in the list

5. Write a C program using dynamic variables and pointers, to construct singly linked list. The operations to be supported are:
   (i) Insert at the front of a list
   (ii) Searching a node based on specified value.
   (iii) Displaying al the nodes in the list

6. Write a C program using dynamic variables and pointers, to construct singly linked list. The operations to be supported are:
   (i) Insert at the front of a list
   (ii) Reverse a linked list element.
   (iii) Displaying al the nodes in the list.

7. Write a C program to support the following operations on doubly linked list where each node consists of integers.
   (i) Create a doubly linked list by adding each node at the front
   (ii) Insert a new node to the left of the node whose key value is read as an input.
   (iii) Display the contents of the list.

8. Write a C program to support the following operations on doubly linked list where each node consists of integers.
   (i) Create a doubly linked list by adding each node at the front
   (ii) Delete the node of a given data, if it is found, otherwise display appropriate message
   (iii) Display the contents of the list.

9. Write a program to design, Develop and Implement a menu- driven program in C for the following operations on STACK of integers (Array implementation of the stack with maximum size MAX = 4). (i) Push an element on to stack. (ii) Pop an element from the stack. (iii) Check Overflow and Underflow situations on the stack. (iv) Display the contents of stack. (v) Exit. Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations.

10(a) Write a Program to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not by using stack.
10(b) Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion.

11. Write a C program to convert an expression given in “infix” from to “postfix” from using stack concept.

12. Write a C program to simulate the working of a queues using an array provide and implement the following operations: (i) Insert (ii) Delete (iii) Display Assume that the size of the queue is 5.

13. Write a C program to implement a circular queue using linked list

14. Write a C program to construct a binary search tree of integers and perform the following operation
    (i) Find the number of leaf nodes in BST
    (j) Print all root to leaf paths of a BST.

15. Write a C program to construct a binary search tree of integers and also display the elements in the tree using Inorder, Preorder and Postorder traversals.

16. Write a C program to sort set of integers using radix sorting technique.
